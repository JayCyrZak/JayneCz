## Development
### Solo Development
The music and sound effects were found online, otherwise I developed the game on my own.
### Technologies Used:
- Godot Game Engine
- Aseprite Image Editor

## How to play
- Unpack the Executable Package anywhere and run the .exe executable to play the game  
- Play with a keyboard or a gamepad (gamepad recommended)
- Turn the plane with the Left Stick or the WASD keys
- Use the thrusters with the Left Trigger or the Shift key
- Shoot with the Right Trigger or the Space key
- Your plane turns much faster when not thrusting or shooting
- The enemy spawn-rate increases over time
- Kills repair the plane
- Try to destroy as many enemy planes as possible before perishing
